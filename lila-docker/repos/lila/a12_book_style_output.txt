The opening battle continues. It's close to equal, with play for both sides. Play revolves around **avoiding premature pawn breaks**.

a) b3 (+0.2)
b) Bd2 (+0.2)
c) cxd5 (-0.6)

**b3**! repositions the piece. The evaluation is essentially balanced.

Alternatively, **Bd2** deserves attention.
**cxd5** is also possible, though slight inaccuracy (0.8).

Neither side has a stable edge yet.
