We are in the opening phase. roughly equal. Pursuing Pawn Chain Maintenance is the key theme.

a) b3 b3 (+0.2)
b) Bd2 Bd2 (+0.2)
c) cxd5 cxd5 (-0.6)

With **b3**!, White improves the piece's scope, keeping roughly equal.

Alternatives:
Alternatively, **Bd2** deserves attention.
Alternatively, **cxd5** (slight inaccuracy (0.8)).

Both sides have their chances.
