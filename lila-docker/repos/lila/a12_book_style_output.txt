A bad bishop problem is limiting piece quality. This is still an opening structure. Move-order precision matters more than forcing lines. The position is about level. The practical roadmap centers on **coordinating piece play before structural commitments**.

a) b3 (+0.2)
b) Bd2 (+0.2)
c) cxd5 (-0.6)

**Bd2** favors structural clarity and methodical handling over complications.
**cxd5** is playable, but slight practical concession.

The position stays tense, and one careless tempo can swing the initiative.
